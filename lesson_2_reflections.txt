What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git meta-file which will track changes through commits. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It doesn't store anything on disk, they're most likely file pointers. 

Fix newline message attempt. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I guess use diff --staged and count the number of commits per logical change.
