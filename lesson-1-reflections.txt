How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By listing the difference side by side so that I could compare them. 
	
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could see what changes were made at different stages, giving insight in what problems there were to solve. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: more control, 
	con: no backstop if you forget to save a change. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because programming generally involves different files. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
